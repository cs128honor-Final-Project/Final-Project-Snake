	~Project Introduction:
	  Our goal is to implement a Snake game, using bevy, in the Rust language. All engine and game logic uses Bevy ECS, a custom Entity Component                 System. It is fast: Massively Parallel and Cache-Friendly. The fastest ECS according to some benchmarks, and simple: Components are Rust structs,           Systems are Rust functions, and Capable: Queries, Global Resources, Local Resources, Change Detection, Lock-Free Parallel Scheduler.
	~System Overview:
	  Our goal is to use bevy to build a game window (board). Then generate food at random positions, so rand is used.

	~Possible Challenges:
	  This project is basically a challenge for the four of us because none of us have ever worked on a project from scratch (usually MP has a starter
	  code), we didn't choose a difficult project like machine learning or AI, and we're not sure we'll end up with a full game, but we'll do our best.
	  The other potential challenge is that we need to do a better job of handling bevy dependencies. Also, we should consider how to implement move             commands.
